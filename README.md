### ***Description***

#### Created to give people a better understanding of what to buy. That way they don't make a mistake and purchase a bad pc.
***

### ***Technologies Used***
* MongoDB

***

### ***Getting Started***

##### Try it on your phone. You're looking to buy a computer, you might be looking at the app on one already.

##### Things I have leaned along the way is, when you need to seed to your Database is to do so early and often to keep your info up to date.
##### A Trello board was used to keep track of development progress and can be viewed [here](https://trello.com/b/V2PeeYi0/project-2).

##### The project has it's own ERD and Components page. This can be viewed [here](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/97f109d2-6394-4e63-9ee2-4dc6d007b9db/edit?invitationId=inv_e49ae07d-f824-4e94-93eb-3ecd6d3ce819&page=0_0#).
##### The project itself was deployed and can be viewed [here](https://rate-my-pc-setup.herokuapp.com).
